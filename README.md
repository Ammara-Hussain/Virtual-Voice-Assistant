# 🎙️ Virtual Voice Assistant (JavaScript + Web Speech API)

A lightweight **Virtual Voice Assistant** built using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
It listens to user commands, speaks back responses, and can perform small automated actions such as opening links or fetching the current date/time.  

This project demonstrates my skills in **front-end development, voice interaction, and UI responsiveness**.
